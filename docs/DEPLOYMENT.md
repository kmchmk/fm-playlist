# Deployment Guide

The app can run as a two-service Docker Compose stack or as an app container
connected to managed Postgres. The app image uses Node 22 on Alpine and Next.js
standalone output.

## Local Or Self-Hosted Compose

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env - set Clerk keys and POSTGRES_PASSWORD at minimum.
docker compose up -d --build
```

The app is served at http://localhost:3000. Postgres is reachable inside the
compose network at `db:5432` and is not published to the host by default.

To reset local state and wipe the DB volume:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

## Required Environment Variables

See [../.env.example](../.env.example) for the full list.

- **Clerk:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is inlined into the client bundle at
  build time, so set it as both a build-time and runtime variable.
- **Postgres:** compose uses `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, and
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to build `DATABASE_URL`. Managed deployments can set
  `DATABASE_URL` directly.
- **Airtable:** `AIRTABLE_API_TOKEN` and `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` are optional. Omit
  them to run from Postgres only.
- **Domain allowlist:** `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` defaults to `favoritemedium.com`.
  Keep it aligned with Clerk's own sign-in restrictions.

## Coolify Or Managed Hosts

### Option A: Docker Compose

1. Create a Docker Compose resource pointed at this repo.
2. Set variables from `.env.example` in the host UI.
3. Assign a domain to the `app` service and enable TLS.

### Option B: App Container Plus Managed Postgres

1. Create a managed Postgres resource and copy its connection string.
2. Create a Docker build resource using the root `Dockerfile`.
3. Set `DATABASE_URL`, Clerk keys, and optional Airtable values.
4. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` as a build variable too.
5. Assign a domain and deploy.

`ensureSchema()` creates or updates the `songs` table on first access.

## Clerk Production Setup

- Add `https://<your-domain>` as an allowed production domain.
- Enable Google sign-in for the production instance.
- Restrict sign-ups/sign-ins to the allowed email domain in Clerk.
- Use production Clerk keys only in production.
- Existing Auth0 sessions do not migrate; users sign in again with Clerk.

## Health Check

`GET /api/health` is public and returns `{"ok": true}`. Docker Compose uses it
as the app container health check.

`GET /api/songs` and `POST /api/songs` are protected and should not be used as
orchestration health checks.

## Operations

- Keep `.env` and `.env.local` out of Git. They are ignored by Git and Docker
  build context rules.
- Rotate Clerk or Airtable credentials if they are copied into a shared place,
  committed by accident, or exposed by build artifacts.
- Back up Postgres before destructive maintenance. For compose deployments,
  data lives in the `postgres_data` volume.
- Watch logs for `[SYNC]` messages. They include Airtable row counts, skipped
  row counts, and inserted row counts.
- Run `npm audit --audit-level=high` and your container scanner before
  releases.

## Troubleshooting

- **`DATABASE_URL is not set`** - the app requires Postgres. Compose wires it
  automatically; managed hosts must set it explicitly.
- **App starts before DB is ready** - compose waits for Postgres health, but
  outside compose the first request can fail until Postgres accepts connections.
- **Clerk keys missing or mixed** - use publishable and secret keys from the
  same Clerk instance.
- **Unexpected account can sign in** - check Clerk restrictions and confirm
  `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` matches the intended domain.
- **Airtable 401/403** - token expired or scoped incorrectly. Fix the token or
  unset Airtable variables to skip sync.
- **Airtable 429** - the app retries with exponential backoff. If it still
  fails, Postgres data is served and the issue is logged.
- **Empty playlist after DB failure** - this should no longer happen. DB
  outages should surface as app/API errors.
- **Build cannot find Clerk key** - set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` at
  build time, not only runtime.
