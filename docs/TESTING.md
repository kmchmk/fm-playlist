# Testing

## Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

`npm run test:watch` starts Vitest in watch mode for local development.

## Current Test Coverage

Unit tests cover:

- YouTube URL parsing and rejection of lookalike hosts
- Date-only normalization and display formatting
- Song submission validation
- API auth/error helper behavior

Test files live beside the code they cover as `*.test.ts` files.

## Manual Smoke Tests

After larger changes, verify these flows in a browser:

1. Signed-out homepage shows the Clerk sign-in button.
2. Allowed-domain user can view the playlist.
3. Forbidden-domain user sees the account restriction message and can switch
   accounts.
4. Search filters submitter, title, artist, and description.
5. Month/year filters stay valid when search changes result sets.
6. Add Track accepts valid YouTube URLs and updates the playlist immediately.
7. Add Track rejects invalid URLs and overlong descriptions visibly.
8. Mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts do not overlap.

## API Checks

With a running app, verify:

- `GET /api/health` returns 200 without authentication.
- `GET /api/songs` rejects unauthenticated users.
- `POST /api/songs` rejects malformed JSON, invalid YouTube URLs, and
  forbidden-domain users.
- Allowed users can submit a valid YouTube URL.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs install, lint, typecheck, tests, and build on
pushes to `main` and pull requests.

The build step requires GitHub Actions secrets named
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`. Use CI-safe Clerk
credentials and keep literal key values out of the workflow file.
